### Quality-of-life DLL mod for Starbound.

By a truly unbelievable coincidence, I was recently out for a walk when I saw a small package fall off a truck ahead of me.  As I got closer, the typeface slowly came into focus: **Starbound**. Inside, I found a pack of jammie dodgers, a furry poster (tells you something about their audience I guess!) and the latest version of the **Starbound source code**!!

## Features

### Character Editor
Repurposes Starbound's character creation pane as an in-game editor, so you can edit your appearance live.

### Character Swapper
Swap with your other selves. The ship of the character you joined as stays, and will save to the original character's ship file.

Swapping immediately saves the previous character. Ship upgrades for a visiting character will not be applied until you join as that character.

## Smooth Tech Scaling
Smoothens tech scaling by changing how it's rendered to scale the drawables instead of the sprites.

Works with any scaling tech that you may have!
