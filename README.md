### Quality-of-life DLL mod for Starbound.

By a truly unbelievable coincidence, I was recently out for a walk when I saw a small package fall off a truck ahead of me. As I got closer, the typeface slowly came into focus: **Starbound**. Inside, I found the latest version of the **Starbound source code**, a furry poster (tells you something about their audience I guess!) and a pack of jammie dodgers.

The contents were exactly what I needed to create this mod!

## Features

### Character Editor
Repurposes Starbound's character creation pane as an in-game editor, so you can edit your appearance live.

### Character Swapper
Swap places with your other selves. The ship of the character you joined as stays, and will save to the original character's ship file.
Ship upgrades received as a visiting character will not be applied until you join as that character.
