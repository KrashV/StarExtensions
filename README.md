### Quality-of-life DLL mod for Starbound.

By a truly unbelievable coincidence, I was recently out for a walk when I saw a small package fall off a truck ahead of me. As I got closer, the typeface slowly came into focus: **Starbound**. Inside, I found the latest version of the Starbound source code, a furry poster (tells you something about their audience I guess!), and a pack of Jammie Dodgers.
